# Choice-of-Games-Save-State-Tool

## '!!! This is still very pre-alpha !!!'

## About the Program

This is a python program to save and load at any point in any Choice of Games Game

This is the first big python program that i have ever made so bug will be plentiful!  

&nbsp;

If you Play any Choice of Games, you will know there is no save slots like in other games, and in Cog Games 1 Choice can lead to a good ending or bad ending... or death.

And as my may or may not know Cog games are bassed on Choose Your Own Adventure Books. In thoes books you can just go back a few pages if you make a wrong choice or die.
This is the point of this tool.
