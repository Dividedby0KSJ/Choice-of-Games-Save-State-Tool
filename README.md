# Choice-of-Games-Save-State-Tool

<h1>!!! This is still very pre-alpha !!!</h1>

<h1>About the Program</h1>
    <p>
        This is a python program to save and load at any point in any Choice of Games Game <br>
        <br> This is the first big python program that i have ever made so bug will be plentiful! <br>
        <br> If you Play any Choice of Games, you will know there is no save slots like in other games, and in Cog Games 1 Choice can lead to a good ending or bad ending... or death. <br>
        <br> And as my may or may not know Cog games are bassed on Choose Your Own Adventure Books. In thoes books you can just go back a few pages if you make a wrong choice or die.
        <br> This is the point of this tool. <br>
